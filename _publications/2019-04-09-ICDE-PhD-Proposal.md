Abstract

Reproducibility plays a crucial role in experimentation. However, the modern research ecosystem and the underlying frameworks are constantly evolving and thereby making it extremely difficult to reliably reproduce scientific
artifacts such as data, algorithms, trained models and visualizations. We therefore aim to design a novel system for assisting data scientists with rigorous end-to-end documentation of data-oriented experiments.
Capturing data lineage, metadata, and other artifacts helps reproducing and sharing experimental results. We summarize this challenge as automated documentation of data science experiments. We aim at reducing manual
overhead for experimenting researchers, and intend to create a novel approach in dataflow and metadata tracking based on the analysis of the experiment source code. The envisioned system will accelerate the research
process in general, and enable capturing fine-grained meta information by deriving a declarative representation of data science experiments.
