I am a Ph.D. student at the [Helmholtz Einstein International Berlin Research School in Data Science](https://www.digital-future.berlin/en/research/heibrids/) (HEIBRiDS), working as a research associate in the [Database Systems and Information Management Group](https://www.dima.tu-berlin.de) (DIMA, TU Berlin) under the co-supervision of [Prof. Volker Markl](https://www.dima.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/volker_markl/) (TU Berlin), [Prof. Uwe Ohler](https://ohlerlab.mdc-berlin.de/profiles/uohler/) (MDC), and [Dr. Sebastian Schelter](https://ssc.io/) (NYU). 

I am focusing my research on reproducibility of data-oriented experiments and end-to-end management of data science processes. Mainly, I am working on novel approaches for streamlining the process of end-to-end tracking of data lineage and meta information, inspecting and persisting digital artifacts that are produced during data science experiments, their sharing and reuse across teams and domains.

Prior to my graduate studies, I obtained my Masters in Data Science from the [University of Sk√∂vde](http://his.se/en/Prospective-student/education/Masters-Studies/Data-Science-Masters-programme-120-ECTS/Student-Interview/), Sweden, working on several interdisciplinary projects that bridged data science and domain expertise in [social robotics](https://www.dream2020.eu/), [production line optimization](https://www.his.se/en/Research/informatics/Skovde-Artificial-Intelligence-Lab/Utvalda-projekt/DataFlow/), and others.
